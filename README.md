# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. It uses Express, MongoDB, Node.js and Mongoose. Postman is used to test server response. Uses sign up and sign in functions. Uses user authorization to see if user can access profile on delete items from the server.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
